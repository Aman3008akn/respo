  # Install deps for frontend and build it. Netlify runs this on their CI.
  command = "npm ci --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend"

# You can set environment variables here, but it's better to set them in the
# Netlify UI (Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment). Example:
# [context.production.environment]
#   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com/api"

[context.production.environment]
# Leave unset in the repo; set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in Netlify dashboard.
